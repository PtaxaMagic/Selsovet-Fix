# Selsovet-Fix
unexisting selsovets are located in unexsisting.lost(love my grammar).
Do not delete lines with selsovet name, if you added selsovet to KB. Just separate it with tab or spaces.

Everything you have to add is this 2 rows for YOUR_SELSOVET

YOUR_SELSOVETS_RAJON_decomposition -> YOUR_SELSOVET;;
YOUR_SELSOVET => nrel_main_idtf: [русский идентификатор  сельсовет](*<-lang_ru;;*);;
